Implementing an advanced information system on a theoretical basis (description of the idea, feasibility study, requirement analysis, diagrams,
technology involved, architecture diagram, identifying and addressing problems and risks and implementation of a demo)

More specifically about the project:

We are trying to develop an advanced information system that will support with new technologies the people who are beneficiaries of the 
"Help at home" public service. Having all in our social circle older people as well as people with mobility difficulties, we can acknowledge 
the difficulties they experience in terms of purchasing goods, serving basic health needs and the need of psychological support. We therefore
propose the development of an information system that will include features such as medical care, provision of necessary goods, servicing of 
daily needs - the above will be achieved by the construction and use of a remote controler with clearly visible buttons, appropriately designed 
in terms of size depending on the needs of the users - as well as measurements of vitals, which will be taken with the help of a smartwatch.
The remote controler will consist of 7 basic buttons which will have the following functions:

* Call the closest hospital 
* Send a notification to the guardian/caregiver of a beneficiary
* Call for providing material goods
* Call for providing psychological/medical/nursing support
* Call for meal provision
* Confirm action
* Reject action
    
In addition, the device will consist of a screen that will show the progress of the requests and due to the existence of a smartwatch, it will 
also display the vital information of the person - pressure, pulse, oxygen and so on. In addition, the idea extends to having a mobile application 
to which a carer/guardian of each person can be connected in order to provide him/her with continuous information about the needs and vital information 
of the particular person and also in case he/she wishes to provide assistance on his/her own.

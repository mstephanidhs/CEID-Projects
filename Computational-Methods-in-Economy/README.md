# Computational-Methods-in-Economy

As part of the "Computational Methods in Economics" course we were asked to upgrade an existing
system of our choice. Therefore, as a team we chose to deal with the renewal of the Urban 
Transportation system of Patras. In particular, we proposed an additional functionality that is 
going to replace the classic paper ticket with an electronic. The tickets will be like 
those that are utilized in Athens since 2020, which are rechargable/reusable.

We primarily focused on analysing the requirements of the specific project and the initial and 
detailied design of it. Specifically, we prepared the below:

* Feasibility Study
* Risk Analysis/Assessment
* Project Description 
* Project Plan
* Use Cases
* Class Diagram
* Entity Relationship Diagram (ERD)
* Team Plan

## 1st Exercise ##

   Given the electrical energy needs of California and the sources from which they are covered, it is required to 
calculate basic statistics, detect any patterns, identify days-outliers using a clustering algorithm and train a 
regressor based on LSTM neural networks in order to guess for each moment of the day how much energy needs to be
produced from non-renewable sources.

## 2nd Exercise ##

   Predict the second column (product rating) of an amazon.csv file which contains user reviews of products and
their ratings. RandomForest and Word Embeddings technique is used.

## Flex-Bison ##

The main goals of the specific project are:

1. the description of a language in BNF format
2. the familiarization with the basic concepts of compilers
3. the implementation of a compiler and a parser using the Bison and Flex tools

The language that was analyzed is a pseudo-language, which follows the logic of the C langunage.

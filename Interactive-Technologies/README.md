## 1st Exercise ##

Consider someone who has to type text in circumstances for which it is not appropriate to use the traditional QWERTY keyboard 
(e.g. a diver wearing gloves, a surgeon, a hiker operating the watch-GPS, a driver operating the car GPS from the
steering wheel, a person with mobility problems due to injury or illness, etc). 
Design an alternative text input method for the above scenario.

## 2nd Exercise ##

Visit https://study.kardsort.com/tourism-website and participate in the open card sorting experiment, which concerns the menu structure 
of a website for visitors of a fictional island. Analyze the results of the experiments using the Windows tool Casolysis, which is availble
from the kardsort.com website (requires an account). Starting with these results you are required to propose a structure for the tourism 
website’s content and to design it, using some wireframes and a prototype.

## 3rd Exercise ##

You are asked to evaluate a website using the Heuristic Evaluation method for the following scenario: A typical user
is visiting a website in order to design the data model of a database.

## 4th Exercise ##

Use the data you have generated with the sheets given to you in the class. Remember that each sheet contains 12 different areas where you 
have made repeat target selections. In time t = 10 sec you have recorded the number of selections you achieved accurately. For each of the 
twelve areas calculate the average duration of target selection (i.e. the duration of movement for each hit), i.e. the quotient total time / (number of options). 
Then present the following items in a table:

* the condition (i.e. the serial number of each area, from 1-12)
* the distance D between the two targets in each area (i.e., the length of the gray area)
* the target width (W), (i.e. the width of each of the targets)
* the degree of difficulty (difficulty index or ID). Use Fitts’s Law, t = a + b * ID, where ID = log2(D / W + 1), the average target selection time you 
calculated above.

Then make a diagram showing the trend line that correlates the degree of difficulty with the time it takes to select the target. Calculate the constants a, b
of the equation t = a + b * ID. How do the values of the constants that you calculated compare with those mentioned in the literature?

## Exercise 5 ##

The aim of the exercise is to experimentally replicate the Stroop effect. To collect the experimental data, download and run the attached JAR file.
This program displays on the screen words that describe colors (yellow, red, green, blue), colored with the corresponding colors and asks you to 
answer which color you see. The program will give you two values at the end: 

* the time it responds to you when the color matches the
the word (color match) 
* and the response time when the color does not match the word (color mismatch).


The goal is to study whether reading interference affects response time regarding the naming of the color, when there is a contradiction between the meaning 
of the word and its color.

## Paper Review ##

For this scientific paper, after studying it, answer the following questions: 

* What is the aim of the paper? 
* What research question are the authors trying to answer? do they?
* How is this work connected to the subject of the course, make specific reference to themes of the theory by commenting on whether there are deviations 
from the theory developed in lesson 
* Describe the method the authors use to prove their research query 
* Make a critical presentation of the results presented
* Describe how you would proceed with this research

## Project ##

The purpose of the assignment is to gain experience with evaluation and human-centered design techniques of a complex system. The field of work is the Banking sector, 
which affects almost all of the citizens. Banks are transferring more and more of their transactions with their customers in systems accessible from the browser or
the mobile phone. You are asked to in-depth evaluate a bank's web and mobile application and then propose a redesign of an ideal application (myOnline-Banking) which
provides its users with easy and fast access to online banking services based on the results of the evaluation phase.

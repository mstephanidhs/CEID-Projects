* 20 students
* 15 courses

* Loads the hospital OWL ontology and applies an inference model
* Allows the retrieval and display of snapshots of the ontology after the selection of a class
by the user
* Allows the insertion of new snapshots
* Allows the search of snapshots based on user-defined parameter values, using SPARQL queries
* Allows the search of snapshots based on parameter values to be specified by the user
